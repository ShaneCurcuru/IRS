The Council hired outside legal counsel and forensic auditors to conduct an internal investigation into the suspicious activity, and terminated the former CFO in March of 2016. During the internal investigation, USCIB learned about a criminal investigation that the federal government and IRS was conducting of the former CFO. In May 2017, the former CFO plead guilty to wire fraud and tax fraud, and USCIB was named as a victim of his crimes. As part of the guilty plea, the former CFO admitted that his crime involved misappropriation of assets from USCIB in the amount of $1,347,259. In addition to the criminal theft, the former CFO agreed to pay an additional $400,000 to USCIB due to amounts of organizational money he used for his personal benefit for which he never reimbursed USCIB.
