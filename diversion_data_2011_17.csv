ON DECEMBER 16, 2013, LAW ENFORCEMENT EXECUTED SEIZURE ORDERS ON BANK ACCOUNTS CONTROLLED BY SMACK. LATER THAT DAY, GSGLA TERMINATED SMACK'S EMPLOYMENT.

IN ADDITION, INVOICE AND CREDIT CARD APPROVAL AS WELL AS CHECK SIGNING PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN ENHANCED. SINCE GSGLA'S INCEPTION ON DECEMBER 1, 2008, ALL SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS, BOARD MEMBERS, AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SIGN AN ANNUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT REQUIRING THEM TO DISCLOSE INTERESTS THAT COULD GIVE RISE TO CONFLICTS. SMACK WITHHELD AND MISREPRESENTED INFORMATION RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL BUSINESS CONFLICTS ON HIS ANNUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. GSGLA WILL CONTINUE TO REGULARLY AND CONSISTENTLY MONITOR AND ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICY. DETAILED OVERSIGHT OVER THE CAPITAL &  OPERATING BUDGETS IS BEING MONITORED AND REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE PROPERTIES AND FINANCE COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD.

IT WAS ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE FORMER EMPLOYEE'S EMPLOYER MATCHING CONTRIBUTION TO HER RETIREMENT ACCOUNT WAS MORE THAN WHAT IS AUTHORIZED AND STATED IN THE PLAN DOCUMENT. BECAUSE THE FORMER EMPLOYEE IS A DISQUALIFIED PERSON, THE OVERFUNDING IS A PROHIBITED TRANSACTION. SUCH DISCRIMINATORY TRANSACTIONS COULD SUBJECT THE SCHOOL TO EXCISE TAXES AND PENALTIES WHICH CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.

BECAUSE THE FORMER EMPLOYEE IS A DISQUALIFIED PERSON, THE OVERFUNDING IS A PROHIBITED TRANSACTION. SUCH DISCRIMINATORY TRANSACTIONS COULD SUBJECT THE SCHOOL TO EXCISE TAXES AND PENALTIES WHICH CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME. THE EXCESS EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION FOR THE PLAN YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2008 THROUGH 2015 WAS $88,589 AND CALCULATED EARNINGS ON THE EXCESS EMPLOYER MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS WAS $14,615. IN AUGUST 2016, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF $103,204 WAS TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE FORMER EMPLOYEE'S RETIREMENT ACCOUNT AND DEPOSITED INTO THE RETIREMENT PLAN'S FORFEITURE ACCOUNT. THE SCHOOL HAS ENGAGED AND INVOLVED OUTSIDE LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS IN ATTEMPTING TO UNDO THE DIVERSION OF THE FUNDS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. AT NO TIME WERE ANY TRUSTEES (OTHER THAN THE FORMER EMPLOYEE WHO CAUSED THE DIVERSION OF FUNDS), OFFICERS, OR OTHER PERSONS EXERCISING SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OVER THE AFFAIRS OF THE SCHOOL AWARE THAT THESE DIVERSIONS OF FUNDS WERE TAKING PLACE, AND AT NO TIME DID THE FORMER EMPLOYEE HAVE ANY AUTHORITY OR APPROVAL TO ENGAGE IN SUCH ACTIONS. THE SCHOOL HAS RETAINED THE SERVICES OF AN EXPERIENCED BUSINESS MANAGER TO IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL CONTROLS AND PRACTICES TO PROTECT THE ASSETS OF THE SCHOOL AND TO BEST ENSURE THAT NO SIMILAR DIVERSIONS OF FUNDS OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. THE SCHOOL HAS ALSO HIRED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE RECOMMENDED CONTROLS AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SUGGESTED BY THE BUSINESS MANAGER AND CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ENGAGED BY THE SCHOOL. SPECIFICALLY, THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED ACTIONS AND POLICIES THAT WILL REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE OVERSIGHT OF SCHOOL FUNDS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH SUCH FUNDS ARE HANDLED AND MONITORED: 1) THE COMPLETION OF ANNUAL AUDITS RATHER THAN REVIEWS OF THE SCHOOL'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BY AN INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE; 2) THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REVISED GENERAL LEDGER CHART OF ACCOUNTS FOR MONITORING REVENUES AND EXPENSES; 3) IN SEPTEMBER OF 2015, A POLICY WAS IMPLEMENTED WHERE ANY CHECK ISSUED BY THE SCHOOL EXCEEDING $5,000.00 REQUIRES DUAL SIGNATURES; 4) THE SCHOOL HAS COMMENCED NEW PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ALL RECEIPTS OF CASH, CREDIT CARDS, AND CHECKS TO ENSURE PROPER CONTROLS; 5) BEGINNING WITH THE 2016-2017 ENROLLMENT YEAR, THE SCHOOL IS USING THE QUICKBOOKS SYSTEM TO BILL AND SEPARATELY RECORD ALL TUITION, FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, TUITION REMISSION, AND AUXILIARY CHARGES BY STUDENT; 6) THE SCHOOL HAS RETAINED AN EXPERIENCED BUSINESS MANAGER ON A PART-TIME BASIS TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL MATTERS FOR THE SCHOOL. THE SCHOOL HAS UTILIZED SEVERAL CONTRACTORS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THIS BUSINESS MANAGER AND HAS HIRED AN INCOMING HEAD OF SCHOOL WHO HOLDS A MASTER'S DEGREE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION IN ADDITION TO EDUCATIONAL CREDENTIALS AND WILL OVERSEE THE SCHOOL'S FINANCES. THE INCOMING HEAD OF SCHOOL CONTRACTED AN EXPERIENCED DIRECTOR OF FINANCE."

ONCE UPON A TIME INC,87-61 111TH STREET,RICHMOND HILL,NY,2014,138676,"AS YOU READ THIS, THE GREATEST TRANSFER OF WEALTH IN OUR HISTORY IS HAPPENING. FIFTY-NINE TRILLION DOLLARS ($59,000,000,000,000) WILL BE PASSED DOWN TO HEIRS AND CHARITIES BETWEEN 2007 AND 2061. MUCH OF THE MONEY THAT GOES TO CHARITIES IS PASSED THROUGH A BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN AND IT IS ONE THAT WORKS GENERALLY. HOWEVER, IT FAILS WHEN ONE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS IS DISHONEST AND TREATS THE CHARITY AS IF IT WERE ITS OWN PERSONAL ATM. JUST AS PARENTS EXERCISE THEIR FAITH AND ENTRUST THEIR PRECIOUS CHILDREN TO OUR CARE, WE AS A NON-PROFIT CORPORATION MUST PLACE OUR TRUST WITH THOSE WHOM WE HAVE DEEMED NOT MERELY TRUSTWORTHY, BUT BEYOND PERSONAL REPROACH AS WELL. SINCE 1980, WE HAVE STRIVEN TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF INTEGRITY, WHILE ESTABLISHING A BASICALLY NON-JUDGMENTAL ENVIRONMENT. WHAT FOLLOWS IS THE STORY OF HOW ONCE UPON A TIME INC. (""OUAT"") MISPLACED ITS TRUST IN AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE PRIMARY MOTIVATION BECAME HIS PERSONAL GAIN AS OPPOSED TO THAT OF THE CHILDREN WHOM WE SERVE ON A DAILY BASIS. IN 1993, DR. BEN ADLER JOINTED OUR FACULTY AS A CONSULTANT. HE HAD SERVED AS BOTH A SCHOOL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AS WELL AS A CONSULTANT AND CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY ANOTHER CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST, WHO HAD KNOWN HIM SINCE THEIR TEENAGE DAYS AS CAMP COUNSELORS AND NOW HAD TWO DAUGHTERS OF HIS OWN ENROLLED IN OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. FOR THREE YEARS DR. ADLER PROVIDED REFERRALS TO FAMILIES IN NEED, OF DONATED STERILE GLOVES AND DRESSINGS FOR THE SCHOOL'S FIRST AID KITS, HELPED ORGANIZE AND MAINTAIN STUDENTS' MEDICAL RECORDS AND WAS GENERALLY HELPFUL IN HIS SERVICE TO OUAT. DURING THIS PERIOD, FUNDRAISING WAS ACCOMPLISHED VIA TWO MAIN STREAMS, BOTH OF WHICH REQUIRED THE HANDS-ON, PROACTIVE APPROACH THAT HAD BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH OUAT. FIRST WAS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FLEA MARKETS, WHICH CONSISTED OF CLIENTS EMPTYING THEIR CLOSETS AND THE RESALE OF THE CONTENTS BY MISS TERRY, WHO UTILIZED THE SCHOOL'S DRIVEWAY FOR THIS PURPOSE. SECONDLY, THE SUBMISSION OF GRANT PROPOSALS, WHICH RESULTED IN NOMINAL SUPPORT FROM LOCAL BANKS, ARTS COUNCILS, POLITICIANS AND, VERY RARELY, CORPORATIONS AND FOUNDATIONS. THE LATTER WAS RESEARCHED AND WRITTEN BY MR. MARK. IN 1996, THE BOARD OF OUAT VOTED TO BEGIN AN ACADEMIC SCHOOL AND THE THEATRE STREET SCHOOL WAS GRANTED ITS FIRST CHARTER BY THE NYS EDUCATION DEPARTMENT. AT THIS JUNCTURE, DR. ADLER, WHO HAD OFTEN VOICED HIS DISDAIN FOR THE FLEA MARKETS - CITING RISK/REWARD FACTORS AND LABOR INTENSIVENESS - APPROACHED OUAT'S BOARD WITH A PASSIVE FUNDRAISER THAT WOULD TRULY BE PASSIVE, BINGO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE PARENT/PSYCHOLOGIST, WHO HAD ORIGINALLY REFERRED DR. ADLER, WAS NOW EMPLOYED BY A NON-PROFIT AGENCY WHICH UTILIZED THESE GAMES FOR THE SAME PURPOSES! OUAT WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED TO SPONSOR BINGO, BEING A 501(C)(3) CORPORATION, FILING ANNUALLY WITH THE CHARITIES BUREAU OF THE NYS ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE BOARD TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE GAMING COMMISSION AND THE NYC DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, THE TWO GOVERNING BODIES OF BINGO. THE ONLY MISSING PIECE WAS THAT OUAT NEEDED A BOARD MEMBER PRESENT AT EACH GAME. DR. ADLER NOT ONLY PRESENTED HIMSELF AS THAT VERY PERSON, BUT VOLUNTEERED TO HANDLE ALL BANKING AND PAPERWORK PERTAINING TO THE GAMES. THE BINGO FACILITY, NOSTRAND BINGO HALL IN MIDWOOD, BROOKLYN, WAS ONLY STEPS FROM HIS HOME AND THE INCOME FROM THE GAMES WOULD RELIEVE A SIGNIFICANT FUNDRAISING BURDEN FROM MR. MARK, MISS TERRY AND THE BOARD MEMBERS OF OUAT. THE BOARD VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO EMBRACE DR. ADLER AS A MEMBER AND IN APPARENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS BUSINESS ACUMEN, VOTED HIM CHAIRMAN. DR. ADLER DID NOT SPECIFY THE INCOME TO BE DERIVED, BUT ASSURED THE BOARD AD OFFICERS OF OUAT THE FUNDRAISING RESULTS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THOSE REALIZED THROUGH THE FLEA MARKETS. TRUE TO HIS WORD, HE BEGAN BY DELIVERING A CHECK TO OUAT FOR $500, THE SUPPOSED INITIAL PAYMENT FOR THE CORPORATION'S SPONSORSHIP OF GAMES AT THE NOSTRAND BINGO HALL. UNBEKNOWN TO EVERYONE AT OUAT WAS THE FACT THAT DR. ADLER AND HIS COHORTS AT THE BINGO HALL WERE SYSTEMATICALLY SKIMMING FUNDS FROM LEGAL BINGO GAMES, RUNNING ADDITIONAL ILLEGAL GAMES, GAMBLING, LAUNDERING MONEYS, AND SELLING STOLEN COMPUTERS AND TELEVISIONS. THIS PERVERSION AND DISTORTION OF THE TRUST PLACED IN DR. ADLER CONTINUED UNDETECTED, AND THUS UNABATED BY OUAT FOR APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS. ONE MAY AND SHOULD ASK: ""HOW DID DR. ADLER MANAGE TO OPERATE THESE BINGO GAMES AS HIS OWN PERSONAL FINANCIAL BAILIWICK FOR A QUARTER CENTURY?"" WITHIN OUAT, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD HAS TWO MAJOR OBLIGATIONS: THE CARRYING OUT OF THE BOARD'S RESOLUTIONS AND PERSONALLY, TREATING OUAT AS A TOP PHILANTHROPIC PRIORITY. DR. ADLER WAS SUBSTANTIVELY EFFECTIVE AS REGARDS COMMUNICATION OF THE BOARD'S RESOLUTIONS AND THE SCHEDULING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAME. IT WAS THE LATTER OBLIGATION THE DR.

OUR TEAM CALLED THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY TO TERMINATE HER CARD AND REQUESTED THE LAST FIVE CHARGES MADE ON THE ACCOUNT. UPON LEARNING THAT THE LAST FIVE WERE ALL PURCHASES OF A PERSONAL NATURE, WE REQUESTED COPIES OF ALL STATEMENTS FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR PRIOR. WE DID THIS BECAUSE UPON LOOKING FOR THE FILE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, THERE WERE NONE.

SEVERAL NEW MEMORIAL HERMANN INITIATIVES ARE UNDER THE STATE OF TEXAS' MEDICAID 1115 WAIVER - TEXAS HEALTH CARE TRANSFORMATION AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM COLLABORATIVE. THE PSYCHIATRIC RESPONSE CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WAS INTRODUCED TO ADDRESS THE GAP IN THE MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL CARE SERVICES BY CONNECTING PATIENTS TO OUTPATIENT TREATMENT AND OTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES. THE INITIATIVE WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INTENSIVE, COMMUNITY-BASED CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR THOSE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS AND A HISTORY OF MULTIPLE HOSPITALIZATIONS. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, PATIENTS ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH CARE PLAN AND LONG-TERM RECOVERY GOALS WITH THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF IMPROVED PATIENT WELLNESS AND GOAL ACHIEVEMENT. THE CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WORKS CLOSELY WITH MEMORIAL HERMANN'S PSYCHIATRIC RESPONSE TEAM, IN WHICH MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS EVALUATE, STABILIZE, ARRANGE FOR TRANSFERS AND DEVELOP AFTERCARE PLANS FOR PATIENTS IN EMERGENCY ROOM AND MEDICAL INPATIENT SETTINGS. THE PSYCHIATRIC RESPONSE TEAM REFERS PATIENTS TO MORE THAN 200 MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY TREATMENT PROVIDERS WITHIN HARRIS, FORT BEND AND MONTGOMERY COUNTIES. THIS LARGE REFERRAL NETWORK ALLOWS THE PROGRAM TO LEVERAGE THE PATIENTS WITH INSURANCE TO OBTAIN CARE FOR THOSE WITHOUT. THIS NETWORK ALSO ELIMINATES A SINGLE FACILITY FROM COMPETING WITH ALL LOCAL EMERGENCY CENTERS FOR LIMITED PSYCHIATRIC RESOURCES. ANOTHER MEMORIAL HERMANN 1115 WAIVER PROGRAM IS THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CLINICS, CREATED IN RESPONSE TO THE SIGNIFICANT GAP IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN HARRIS AND SURROUNDING COUNTIES. MEMORIAL HERMANN CREATED MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CLINICS THAT PROVIDE RAPID ACCESS TO INITIAL PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT AND OUTPATIENT MULTI-DISCIPLINARY SERVICES FOR PATIENTS WITH NO IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE.

THE NURSE HEALTH LINE WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2014 AS A FREE TELEPHONE SERVICE FOR GREATER HOUSTON RESIDENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A HEALTH CONCERN AND ARE UNSURE OF WHAT TO DO OR WHERE TO GO. EXPERIENCED, BILINGUAL NURSES USE THEIR TRAINING AND EXPERTISE TO CONDUCT ASSESSMENTS BY PHONE, AND ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER CALLS 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FOR ANY RESIDENT LIVING IN HARRIS OR SURROUNDING COUNTIES. THEY HELP CALLERS DECIDE WHEN AND WHERE TO GO FOR MEDICAL CARE AND ASSIST WITH SOCIAL SERVICE REFERRALS AND TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. CALLERS RECEIVE HEALTHCARE ADVICE AND EDUCATION USING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS. DOCUMENTED OUTCOMES INCLUDE: 5,000 CALLS PER MONTH; 67% OF TRIAGED CALLERS WERE DIRECTED TO PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS AS COMPARED TO 33% TO THE ER; 96% WERE REFERRED TO PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS; 895 OF CALLERS FOLLOWED THE CARE ADVICE OF THE NURSE; AND, 99% OF CALLERS WOULD USE THE SERVICE AGAIN.

OUP IMMEDIATELY INSTRUCTED EXTERNAL LAWYERS AND FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS TO UNDERTAKE A COMPREHENSIVE AND DETAILED INVESTIGATION.

BECAUSE TWO OF THE TENDERS WERE FUNDED BY THE WORLD BANK, OUP ALSO VOLUNTARILY REPORTED A POTENTIAL BREACH OF THE WORLD BANK'S PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES TO THE WORLD BANK. THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION LED THE SFO AND WORLD BANK TO BELIEVE THAT THE TWO OUP SUBSIDIARIES HAD OFFERED AND MADE PAYMENTS, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH AGENTS, INTENDED TO INDUCE THE RECIPIENTS TO AWARD COMPETITIVE TENDERS AND/OR PUBLISHING CONTRACTS FOR SCHOOLBOOKS TO THESE TWO COMPANIES. FOLLOWING AN ACCOUNTING EXAMINATION OF THE BENEFIT OBTAINED FROM THE AFFECTED CONTRACTS, AND USING A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO ESTIMATE COSTS, A CIVIL RECOVERY WAS AGREED WITH THE SFO OF 1.9 MILLION POUNDS (UK) PLUS COSTS OF 12,500 POUNDS. AGREEMENT ALSO WAS REACHED WITH THE WORLD BANK THAT OUP EAST AFRICA AND OUP TANZANIA WOULD BE DEBARRED FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS AND THE REST OF OUP WOULD BE CONDITIONALLY DEBARRED.
